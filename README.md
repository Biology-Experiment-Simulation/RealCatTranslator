# RealCatTranslator
Project in several phases to ultimately built an app that translate from human to cats and cats to human using deep learning algorithm
For all cat lovers by Lea B and Herve B


Phase 1: Collection of cat sound samples in a specific format with annotation of the cat behaviour following a prescribed method for each predesignated designed behavours (eg hungry, don't bother me, etc.).
(---> Current Status)
  * this requires:
    - a collection methodology to collect high quality samples (could be an instruction or small mobile app)
    - a storage repository of raw sample and file naming convention
  * the initial stage will concentrate on single cat candidate before apply machine learning to a mixture of cat candidates
  
  Phase 2: Data manipulation and preparation for deep learning
  Phase 3: Machine learning on initial sample (this could branch out depending on machine learning algorith used)
  Phase 4: App development to apply the learned model to real situation and use language recognition to speak cat language
